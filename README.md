# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Google Certification Capstone Project

**Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also oﬀering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day.

**Scenario**
I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

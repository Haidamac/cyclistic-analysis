under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

**Load packages**

Set of packages for data tidying, manipulation and visualization:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

**Collect data**

Import csv-files into temporary data-frames:
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Haidamac/Documents")
td202207 <- read.csv("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202208 <- read.csv("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202209 <- read.csv("202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv")
td202210 <- read.csv("202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202211 <- read.csv("202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202212 <- read.csv("202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202301 <- read.csv("202301-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202302 <- read.csv("202302-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202303 <- read.csv("202303-divvy-tripdata.csv")

td202305 <- read.csv("202305-divvy-tripdata.csv")
td202306 <- read.csv("202306-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

Merge monthly temporary data-frames in single data-frame:
```{r}
trip_data <- rbind(td202207,td202208,td202209,td202210,td202211,td202212,
                   td202301,td202302,td202303,td202304,td202305,td202306)
```

Check structure of data frame:
```{r}
str(trip_data)
```
Data frame contains 5773649 observations of 13 variables

Check names of variable:
```{r}
colnames(trip_data)
```
Data frame contains 13 variables according to metadata description

Check 6 first records of data frame:
```{r}
head(trip_data)
```

Therefore, the composition of the data and the sample are sufficient to achieve the goal of the analysis

### 3. Process {#3-process}

**Tools for analysis**

R (RStudio) with tinyverse packages are used

**Clean data**

Key tasks:

* Duplicate records in data frame should be excluded
* Rides with n/a data and missing data should be excluded
* Rides that did not include a start or end station should be excluded

Check number of rows before cleaning:
```{r}
rows_before <- nrow(trip_data)
```

Check data frame for N/A records:
```{r}
na_records <- is.na(trip_data)
na_count_per_column <- colSums(na_records)
total_na_count <- sum(na_records)
```
Data frame contains 11590 N/A records

Drop N/A:
```{r}
trip_data <- drop_na(trip_data)
```

Check for duplicate ride_ids:
```{r}
anyDuplicated(trip_data$ride_id)
```
Data frame contains no duplicate records

Clean all missing values:
```{r}
trip_data <- trip_data[!(trip_data$start_station_name == "" |
                           trip_data$start_station_id == "" |
                           trip_data$end_station_name == "" |
                           trip_data$end_station_id == "" ),]
```

Check number of row after cleaning:
```{r}
rows_after <- nrow(trip_data)
```

Number of removed rows during cleaning:
```{r}
print(paste("Removed", rows_before - rows_after, " rows during cleaning"))
```
So, removed 1364560 rows, but the remaining sample of 4,409,089 observations is sufficient for the analysis

**Transform data**

Key tasks:

* Check data for the correct datatype
* Add and calculate necessary columns for further analysis
* Rides less than 1 minute in duration should be excluded
* Rides greater than 24 hours in duration should be excluded

Check of properly data format:
```{r}
summary(trip_data)
```
Variables _started_at_ and _ended_at_ have _character_ but need _datetime_

Convert this columns in datetime format:
```{r}
trip_data$started_at <- ymd_hms(trip_data$started_at)
trip_data$ended_at <- ymd_hms(trip_data$ended_at)
```

Check of properly data format again:
```{r}
skim(trip_data)
```

Add _duration_ column (duration of each ride in seconds) for further analysis:
```{r}
trip_data$duration <- as.numeric(trip_data$ended_at - trip_data$started_at, units = "secs")
```
Add _month_ column
```{r}
trip_data$month <- month(trip_data$started_at, label = TRUE, locale = "en")
```
Add _weekday_ column
```{r}
trip_data$weekday <- wday(trip_data$started_at, label = TRUE, locale = "en")
```
Add _dayhour_ column
```{r}
trip_data$dayhour <- hour(trip_data$started_at)
```
And check new column for errors:
```{r}
skim(trip_data)
```
We got some records with negative duration
Create subset with records of negative duration only:
```{r}
negative_duration <- trip_data %>% 
  filter(duration < 0)
```
Check dimension of subset:
```{r}
dim(negative_duration)
```
We have 76 records with negative duration
Preview of subset:
```{r}
head(negative_duration)
```
6 first records with negative duration have same start and end station name.
So, we assume the trip just didn't happen

Same procedure for zero duration:
```{r}
zero_duration <- trip_data %>% 
  filter(duration == 0)
dim(zero_duration)
```
We have 263 records with duration in 0 second, therefor trips just didn't happen too

We also need to search for trips lasting less than one minute, because this most likely indicates technical malfunctions during the bike rental and the refusal of further trips:
```{r}
short_duration <- trip_data %>% 
  filter(duration < 60)
dim(short_duration)
```
There are 90653 observations with ride duration less than 1 minute. 

We also need to search for rides greater than 24 hours, because it probably indicates test rides
```{r}
long_duration <- trip_data %>% 
  filter(duration > 86400)
dim(long_duration)
```
There are 105 rides with long duration

We need to clean our data from this records (negative, zero and short duration):
```{r}
trip_data <- trip_data[!(trip_data$duration < 60 | trip_data$duration > 86400),]
```
Data is ready for analysis


### 4. Analyze {#4-analyze}

Key tasks:
* Aggregate data for rides distributions
* Identify trends and relationships

**Distribution of rides by user types**

```{r}
rd_usertype <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarize(count = length(member_casual), part_rides = (length(member_casual) / nrow(trip_data)) * 100 )

print(rd_usertype)
```
So, we can see 61.9% all rides are made by members who purchased an Annual Membership and a little more than a third (38.1%) - by other users ([figure 1](#figure 1))

**Distribution of rides by user types and month**

```{r}
rd_month <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarise(count = length(month),
            .groups = "drop")
```

Calculation mean and standard deviation of monthly rides for casual and member users separately:
* for casual users:
```{r}
casual_rd_month <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(month), .groups = "drop")
casual_rd_month %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
* for members:
```{r}
member_rd_month <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(month), .groups = "drop")
member_rd_month %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
Therefore, the standard deviation for casual users (98516) is higher than the standard deviation for members (88568). Thus, seasonality is more pronounced for casual users.
Demand is much lower in the winter months than in the summer. This is natural for bike trips. But for casual users this seasonality is more pronounced than for members ([figure 2](#figure 2))

**Distribution of rides by user types and day of the week**

```{r}
rd_weekday <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(count = length(weekday),
            .groups = "drop")
```
Calculation mean and standard deviation of daily rides for casual and member users separately:
* for casual users:
```{r}
casual_rd_weekday <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(weekday), .groups = "drop")
casual_rd_weekday %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
* for members:
```{r}
member_rd_weekday <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(weekday), .groups = "drop")
member_rd_weekday %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
Therefore, the standard deviation for casual users (56145) is somewhat higher than the standard deviation for members (54021). 
Demand is significantly higher in weekends for casual users. Thus, we can assume that they mainly use bicycle rental for recreation. Members, on the other hand, mostly use bike rental on weekdays, so we assume they use our service for commuting ([figure 3](#figure 3))

**Distribution of rides by user types and hour of the day**

```{r}
rd_dayhour <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, dayhour) %>%
  summarise(count = length(dayhour),
            .groups = "drop")
```
Calculation mean and standard deviation of hourly rides for casual and member users separately:
* for casual users:
```{r}
casual_rd_dayhour <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(dayhour) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(dayhour), .groups = "drop")
casual_rd_dayhour %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
* for members:
```{r}
member_rd_dayhour <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(dayhour) %>%
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>% 
  summarise(count = length(dayhour), .groups = "drop")
member_rd_dayhour %>% 
  summarise(mean(count),sd(count))
```
Therefore, the standard deviation for casual users (47885) is more lower than the standard deviation for members (79353). 
Members have a clear preference for morning and evening bike rentals, supporting our assumption that they use bike commuting to and from the work. Whereas casual users use bike rental more evenly throughout the day ([figure 4](#figure 4))


**Distribution of rides by user types and type of vehicle**

```{r}
rd_rideable_type <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(count = length(rideable_type),
            .groups = "drop")
print(rd_rideable_type)
```
Casual users prefer both classic and electric bikes equally but sometimes choose docked bikes. Members prefer classic bikes, less - electric ones ([figure5](#figure 5)).


**Distribution of rides by user types and start station**



**Distribution of rides by user types and end station**



**Distribution of rides by user types and duration of ride**

```{r}
rd_duration <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(duration), min = min(duration), max = max(duration), 
            sd = sd(duration), median = median(duration), .groups = "drop")
print(rd_duration)
```
The average trip duration of a casual user is almost twice that of a member ([figure8](#figure 8))
However, if we exclude the extreme values (median), this difference is no longer so significant ([figure9](#figure 9))

**Distribution of ride duration by user types and month**

```{r}
duration_month <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(duration), min = min(duration), max = max(duration), 
            sd = sd(duration), median = median(duration), .groups = "drop")
print(duration_month)
```
The standard deviation of a casual user's ride duration is almost double that of a member. This is well illustrated by the chart of median trip duration by month ([figure10](#figure 10)). The difference in trip length for the casual user in the summer months is much greater than in the winter, while the difference is less noticeable for members. This supports our hypothesis that members mostly use bike rental for commuting, while casual users for leisure, this explains the seasonality.

**Distribution of ride duration by user types and day of the week**

```{r}
duration_weekday <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(duration), min = min(duration), max = max(duration), 
            sd = sd(duration), median = median(duration), .groups = "drop")
print(duration_weekday)
```

The same hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of the median duration of the ride by day of the week. For casual users it is significantly higher on weekends than on weekdays, while for members the difference is not as significant ([figure11](#figure 11)).

**Distribution of ride duration by user types and hour of the day**

```{r}
duration_dayhour <- trip_data %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, dayhour) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(duration), min = min(duration), max = max(duration), 
            sd = sd(duration), median = median(duration), .groups = "drop")
```

The duration of the members' trip is virtually independent of the time of day, while the dependence is significant for casual users: the longest trips are in the middle of the day, while the shortest are in the morning ([figure12](#figure 12))
